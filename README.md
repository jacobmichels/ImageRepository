# ImageRepository
Hello! Welcome to the image repository I build for my Shopify Summer 2021 application.

# Usage Instructions
Please note this release targeted 64-bit Windows. It probably won't run on anything else.
1. Go to releases and download the zip files under the 1.0 release.
2. Once downloaded, extract this file somewhere onto your computer.
3. Run the file "ImageRepository.Server.exe". This will start the application.
4. Navigate to https://localhost:5001 to access the Image Repository client.

From here, you are free to test out the functionality of my image repository! I have created an example account with some images already uploaded for you, but you can create your own account and upload your own images too.
